## The Project

Today, a friend posed a question in the group chat. What place in the world/building type has the smallest shadow. His thought process was building sustainable cities ie allowing for more

However, as an engineer tends to do I over engineered and analyzed it.

Software Engineering (brute force) ie stuff made here vs math vs logic

Domain knowledge for steps, clamping

### Domain Knowledge

## Gradient Descent

## Results
- Create graphs of very cities and analyze them

## Application and Learnings
